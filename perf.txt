on macOS M1:

* constant CPU usage: 5%

* time till first frame: 89ms
  (startup time)

17ms baseline Deno
+ font parsing, atlas lookup
+ wasm loading and "npm:sharp"

* avg per frame time: 8ms

I am rendering each glyph shape and writing into the texture
this can probably go even down with some caching.

Bonus: lazy loading of fonts and images for faster startup
